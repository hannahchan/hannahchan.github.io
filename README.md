# hannahchan.dev

My personal website [hannahchan.dev](https://hannahchan.dev) is hosted in this repository and is served via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). It's a simple static website that I use as a reference and learning tool for HTML and CSS.

I can't take credit for the design though as this goes to a guy named [Jeremy Thomas](https://jgthms.com/). The design comes from his book [CSS in 44 minutes](https://jgthms.com/css-in-44-minutes-ebook/) which I recommend you buy as a quick-start to front-end development.
